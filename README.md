# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

This repository contains the results of an analytical project that follows the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. By leveraging various data sources, including behavioral and transactional information, we aim to build a predictive model that assesses each applicant's repayment capability. This analysis will assist in making informed credit decisions and managing potential risks.

### Buisiness Value

The primary business value of this project is the ability to predict the likelihood of loan default, which is essential for financial institutions in minimizing credit risk and improving their lending strategies. By accurately assessing the risk of individual applicants, the model helps in making data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals, interest rates, and credit limits. 

This analysis can lead to:
- **Reduced Default Rates**: By identifying high-risk applicants early, banks and lending institutions can take preventive measures, such as offering alternative terms or denying high-risk loans.
- **Increased Operational Efficiency**: Automating the decision-making process with a predictive model reduces the time and effort required for manual risk assessments.
- **Improved Customer Experience**: By optimizing loan offerings based on predicted risk, financial institutions can tailor their services, ensuring that applicants are more likely to receive loans suited to their financial situations.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Proper risk management and accurate credit assessments help financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements around lending practices and risk exposure.
- **Enhanced Marketing and Sales**: Beyond risk management, the provided data offers valuable insights into customer demographics, behavior, and financial history. This information can be leveraged by marketing and sales teams to better target potential customers, personalize product offerings, and identify profitable segments of the market.

Ultimately, this project contributes to better financial decision-making, risk management, and business growth, leading to higher profitability and sustainability for lending institutions.

### Methodology

We adhere to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, which consists of the following phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Grasping the project's objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collecting and familiarizing ourselves with the data to identify quality issues and gain initial insights.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming the data to create a suitable dataset for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Applying various modeling techniques to the prepared data to develop predictive models.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models to ensure they meet business objectives and selecting the best-performing one.
6. **Deployment**: Implementing the selected model into a real-world application for practical use.
