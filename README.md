# Home Credit Default Risk Analysis

This repository contains the results of an analytical project that follows the CRISP-DM methodology to analyze the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an applicant defaulting on a loan. By leveraging various data sources, including behavioral and transactional information, we aim to build a predictive model that assesses each applicant's repayment capability. This analysis will assist in making informed credit decisions and managing potential risks.

### Methodology

We adhere to the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, which consists of the following phases:

1. **Business Understanding**: Grasping the project's objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
2. **Data Understanding**: Collecting and familiarizing ourselves with the data to identify quality issues and gain initial insights.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and transforming the data to create a suitable dataset for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Applying various modeling techniques to the prepared data to develop predictive models.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models to ensure they meet business objectives and selecting the best-performing one.
6. **Deployment**: Implementing the selected model into a real-world application for practical use.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Home Credit Default Risk competition on Kaggle. It comprises extensive information on loan applicants, including demographic details, financial status, and past loan records.
