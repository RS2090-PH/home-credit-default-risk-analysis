Details:

-   Audience: The loan applicant selection and processing team.
-   Root Problem: The unbanked and underserved population often have a hard time obtaining financial loans and tend to be penalized due to their limited or unattended credit history. The problem here is to hone in on accurate applicant repayment capability which should allow us to clearly define how risky an applicant is for loan decision-making.
-   Benefit of a Solution: Knowing the default risk allows Home Credit to provide manageable lender services and positive experiences for the applicants using alternative data that should open up the potential for their lender market.
-   Approach: In this case a logarithmic model will be used without overlaying a decision threshold classifier. Since the goal isn't to return a Boolean value of whether the applicant will or won't default, we simply need the result of their potential probability of defaulting which a logarithmic model will provide.
-   Performance assessed using area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve.
