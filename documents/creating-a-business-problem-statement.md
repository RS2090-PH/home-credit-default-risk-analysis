Problem Statement Steps:

1. Stakeholder Analysis
    - Determine Mendelow's Matrix
    - Perform Interviews
      Questions
        - Who is involved, impacted or influenced
        - What is the problem or opportunity
        - When are key milestones, deadlines, decisions
        - Where will the work take place
        - Why does the problem occur
          Interviewees
        - Client
        - Sponsors
        - Helpers
        - Stakeholders
        - Subject Matter Experts
        - Decision Makers
2. Problem Analysis
   Tame Problems
    - Organizational Complexity: Difficult group dynamics
      or many stakeholders with differing objectives
      perspective and beliefs.
    - Content Complexity: Too much or too little data, many
      different scenarios each of which may have multiple
      alternatives, few subject matter experts, biases in
      the data or constantly evolving industry values and
      business models/environments.
    - Analytic Complexity: Uncertainty, lots of interdependent
      variables, dynamic business and industry cycles, or
      multiple value measures. Only this type of problem
      can be solved analytically.
      Wicked Problems
    - Poorly defined and difficult to understand.
    - Complex and tangled roots.
    - Many opposed stakeholders.
    - Conditions that change as solutions are attempted.
    - Not clear when a solution is successful.
    - Difficult or impossible to solve.
3. Frame Business Problem
   Create an Initial Problem Statement
    - Business Problem: What is the root problem? Explain
      the problem and describe why it is a problem. Be
      detailed, including metrics. Consider the audience.
    - Benefit of a Solution: How will the business benefit
      from a solution?
    - Analytic Approach: What is the general character of
      the analytics approach to solving the problem?
      Generalize and consider audience. Mention the approach
      but don't get too into detail.
    - Success Metrics: How will stakeholders judge whether
      the project was a success?
    - Scope: What will be delivered and what will be out
      of scope? What might be added later? This sets
      clear boundaries for what the project will and will
      not address. Define deliverables, clarify exclusions,
      outline limitations, future opportunities, stakeholder
      expectations, dependencies and timelines/milestones.
      "Any additional deliverables must be agreed upon and
      represented in a revised business problem statement"
    - Details: Who is going to execute the project? When
      will the project be finished? Are there important
      project milestones?
      Circulate to Stakeholders for Approval
      Revise/Finalize Initial Statement from Input
