Problem Statement Steps:
1. Stakeholder Analysis
	- Determine Mendelow's Matrix
	- Perform Interviews
		Questions
		- Who is involved, impacted or influcenced
		- What is the problem or opportunity
		- When are key milestones, deadlines, decisions
		- Where will the work take place
		- Why does the problem occur
		Interviewees
		- Client
		- Sponsors
		- Helpers
		- Stakeholders
		- Subject Matter Experts
		- Decision Makers
2. Problem Analysis
	Tame Problems
	- Organizational Complexity: Difficult group dynamics 
		or many stakeholders with differeing objective,s 
		perspective and beliefs.
	- Content Complexity: Too much or too little data, many 
		different scenarios each of which may have multiple 
		alternatives, few subject matter experts, biases in 
		the data or constantly evolving industry values and 
		business models/environments.
	- Analytic Complexity: Uncertainty, lots of interdependent 
		variables, dynamic business and industry cycles, or 
		multiple value measures. Only this type of problem
		can be solved analytically.
	Wicked Problems
	- Poorly defined and difficult to understand. 
	- Complex and tangled roots. 
	- Many opposed stakeholders. 
	- Conditions that change as solutions are attempted. 
	- Not clear when a solution is successful. 
	- Difficult or impossible to solve.
3. Frame Business Problem
	Create an Initial Problem Statement
	- Business Problem: What is the root problem? Explain
		the problem and describe why it is a problem. Be 
		detailed, including metrics. Consider the audience.
	- Benefit of a Solution: How will the business benefit 
		from a solution?
	- Analytic Approach: What is the general character of 
		the analytics approach to solving the problem? 
		Generalize and consider audience.
	- Success Metrics: How will stakeholders judge whether 
		the project was a success?
	- Scope: What will be delivered and what will be out 
		of scope? What might be added later? This sets
		clear boundries for what the project will and will 
		not address. Define deliverables, clarify exclusions,
		outline limitations, future opportunities, stakeholder
		expectations, dependencies and timelines/milestones.
		"Any additional deliverables must be agreed upon and
		represented in a revised business problem statement"
	- Details: Who is going to execute the project? When
		will the project be finished? Are there important
		project milestones?
	Circulate to Stakeholders for Approval
	Revise/Finalize Initial Statement from Input
